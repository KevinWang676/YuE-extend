[verse]
Everything my friends have told me about you 
was true
now it's over (ever through)

[chorus]
You have your lady
That happens your way.
So can you blame me
For walking away?

[verse]
Why can't I crew through?
You treated so bad (treated so bad)
Now you have lost me 
Now was I the best thing you ever had?

[chorus]
I don't know what's going on (what's going on.)
But I've claimed the strength to finally move on.
Your hollow excuses, I'll rise above —
This heart's done singing your twisted love.

[verse]
You swore you'd change, but the cracks still showed,
Same old venom in every ode.
Now I'm stitching the wounds you sewed,
A brighter road where my light's bestowed.

[verse]
Let the world see what you threw away,
A love that burned while you chased the gray.
I'll bloom in the sun, no shade from your rain,
You'll whisper my name… but I've erased the pain.
