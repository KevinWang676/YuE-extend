[verse]
Everything my friends have told me about you 
was true
now it's over (ever through)

[chorus]
You have your lady
That happens your way.
So can you blame me
For walking away?

[verse]
Why can't I crew through?
You treated so bad (treated so bad)
Now you have lost me 
Now was I the best thing you ever had?

[chorus]
I don't know what's going on (what's going on.)
